1. [What is Makefile?](https://opensource.com/article/18/8/what-how-makefile)<br>
This website tell us about what is Makefile, the use of it and also how to make it. What interesting is there also a code demo to make us more understand about makefile.

2. [Local, Global and Static Varible](https://overiq.com/c-programming-101/local-global-and-static-variables-in-c/)<br>
This is a website about Local, Global and Static variable used in C programming language. There are simple explanation about it and also demo code with an output for all demo code. It is intereseting because there also an explanation about why the code have an output like that. There are also related article which cover basic of C programming language tutorial in this website.

3. [Memory Map in C](https://automotivetechis.wordpress.com/2012/06/07/memory-map-in-c/)<br>
This website is like a complete explanation about Memory Map in C. There are a visualization that make us understand more. It is interesting that this website have a beautiful design, like using table, usign code formatter that make it nicer to read it.

4. [Pointer in C](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mw1qsMieK5c)<br>
I personally think learning pointer in C is hard, so instead of using textbook or article to learn it, it is better to watch a video about pointer in C. Also this video have a great visualization how pointer works and also code demo written in Vim that really interesting for me

5. [Memory Address in C](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEaMpbVGRaQ)<br>
For the same reason in point number 4, I personally think that it is easier to learn Memory address using videos. This is one of many video that teach you how Memory Address works in C. It is really great because there are a code demo.

6. [Struct in C](https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/c-structures)<br>
This is the simple explanation about Struct in C, how to use it, when to use it and also what intereseting is there are a code demo.

7. [Struct vs Class](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2750270/c-c-struct-vs-class)<br>
In my first time learn about Struct I thought that Struct is the same as Class in Java or other programming  language. Although is slightly different but there are still diffrences between these two word. So, I found disccussion in StackOverFlow that disscuss about this and it is very interesting for me.

8. [Static vs Dynamic Libraries in Linux](https://opensource.com/article/21/2/linux-software-libraries)<br>
This is a comparison between Static and Dynamic Libraries in Linux with also the usecase of these two libraries. What interesting is there also a connection with C language.

9. [Big Endian vs Little Endian](https://aticleworld.com/little-and-big-endian-importance/)<br>
This website is tell us about complete explanation with Big Endian and Little Endian. It is very good because we go in-depth with litte and big endian. Also what interesting is this website tell us about the concept of little endian and big endian using C programming language that are related to what we learn in this week.

10. [Passing Parameter Techniques in C](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/parameter-passing-techniques-in-c-cpp/)<br>
Because of the C pointer, passing parameter in C is slightly different from Java or Python. This website is telling us how to passing parameter correctly in C. It is really interesting because there are visualization how things works and also demo code for the different type of passing paramater in C
